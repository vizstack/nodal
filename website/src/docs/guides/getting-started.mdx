# Getting started

## Installation

Getting started with Nodal is super easy. Just install it as a Node package:

```
npm install nodal
```

## Using a preset

You can immediately start laying out graphs using one of our presets. This option is great for application designers with little to no experience in graph layout.

*TODO: Add data and code for a preset.*

## Using a custom algorithm

You can also configure your own custom layout algorithm. This option is great for designers that really want to tweak the aesthetics for their use case, and for researchers developing novel algorithms.

Here are some steps to get started:

1. Take a look at the [interactive demo](/) on the home page. It shows a working example of how to integrate different features into a layout.
2. Familizarize yourself with the [architecture](/guides/architecture) and [abstractions](/api) in the library.
3. Read more about the [research](/guides/further-reading) that forms the framework for Nodal's approach.
