# Introduction

Nodal is a powerful open-source library for graph layout. It enables you to start building beautiful graphs immediately, or configure your own algorithm for any use case.

## Why?

There are plenty of graph layout libraries out there, why build another one? That's what we thought too when we first started working on our graph-heavy a project: one that required visualizing complex software structures like dependencies and computation graphs. But as we'd learn soon enough, there are many problems with existing libraries:

- Simple layouts only.
- Weird node/edge model.
- Monolithic algorithms.
- Hard to tune aesthetics.
- Crappy implementation.
- Costly.

## Philosophy

- **Composable**:
Nodal allows you to build graph layouts by assembling small, predictable pieces (like points, forces, and constraints) into more complex structures and behaviors.

- **Hackable**:
Nodal is designed with an appreciation of the diversity of graph layout needs. Its elegant, well-documented abstractions are easy to extend or replace for domain-specific applications.

- **Intuitive**:
Nodal is based on gradient-descent rather than the inscrutable algorithms of traditional layout. This allows you to leverage physical and geometric intuitions while tuning your graphs.

## Features
For graph designers:
- Compound nodes
- Different shapes
- Named ports
- Edge angle snap
- Multidirectional flow
- Non-overlap constraints
- Constraints, e.g. alignment, distance
- Animation/interaction hooks

For algorithm builders:
- Small, composable abstractions.
- Layered architecture.
- Elegant, well-documented code.
- Open-source with MIT License.
